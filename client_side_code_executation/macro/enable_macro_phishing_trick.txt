1. we’ll propose that the attached job application document is encrypted to protect its content in accordance with GDPR93 regulations.

2. create a copy of this Word document, and delete the existing text content. Next, we’ll insert “decrypted” content, which will display when the user enables macros. This content will include the simple fake CV
-- With the text created, we’ll mark it and navigate to Insert > Quick Parts > AutoTexts and Save Selection to AutoText Gallery

3. In the Create New Building Block dialog box, we’ll enter the name “TheDoc”

4. With the content stored, we can delete it from the main text area of the document. Next, we’ll copy the fake RSA encrypted text from the original Word document and insert it into the main text area of this document. 

5. Now we’ll need to edit the VBA macro, inserting commands that will delete the fake RSA 
   encrypted text and replace it with the fake CV from the AutoText entry.
